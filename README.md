Short tutorial on Pandas for Python: Understanding the Seven Relational Operations

In relational theory, there are seven relational operations that are considered the most important. These operations include Projection, Restriction, Union, Intersection, Difference, Join, and Cartesian Product. These operations can be combined in a single SQL SELECT statement and they also have their implementation in Pandas.

Let's take a closer look at the Projection operation in Pandas. In SQL, this operation is performed by selecting only the necessary columns in the SELECT clause of a SELECT statement. In Pandas, this is achieved by selecting a list of columns from a DataFrame and placing them in square brackets.
